# 3. User Interface Design Goals

### 3.1. Overall UX Vision

The user experience should be immediate, intuitive, and focused purely on gameplay. The goal is a "pick up and play" feel, with no tutorials or complex menus. The interface should feel like a modern enhancement of a classic arcade cabinet experience, prioritizing fast load times and responsive controls. The design should be clean, unobtrusive, and allow the gameplay itself to be the star.

### 3.2. Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Direct Control:** The player will have immediate and direct control over the jet via keyboard (desktop) or touch (mobile).
*   **Minimalist HUD:** The Heads-Up Display will be simple, showing only essential information: Score, Fuel, and remaining Bombs.
*   **Single-Action Inputs:** Core actions (fire, bomb) will be mapped to single, intuitive inputs.

### 3.3. Core Screens and Views

*   **Start Screen:** A simple screen with the game's title and a "Click to Start" prompt.
*   **Game View:** The main gameplay area where all action takes place.
*   **Game Over Screen:** A screen displaying the final score and a "Play Again" button.

### 3.4. Accessibility: WCAG AA

While a fast-paced action game presents challenges, we will aim for WCAG AA compliance where feasible. This includes ensuring high-contrast UI elements (like the HUD) and allowing for remappable keys in a future version.

### 3.5. Branding

The branding will evoke the classic Atari 2600 era. This includes using pixelated fonts, a limited color palette reminiscent of early consoles, and a logo design inspired by 1980s video game box art.

### 3.6. Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The game must be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile web browsers. Controls will adapt to the input method (keyboard for desktop, on-screen touch controls for mobile).

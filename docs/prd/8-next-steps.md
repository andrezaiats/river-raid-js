# 8. Next Steps

### 8.1. UX Expert Prompt

> `@ux-expert, please review the attached Product Requirements Document (`docs/prd.md`). Based on the "User Interface Design Goals" (Section 3), please develop a comprehensive UI/UX strategy. Your primary focus should be on creating a minimalist, retro-inspired UI that is highly intuitive for both desktop and mobile players. Please provide mockups for the core screens (Start, Game, Game Over) and a style guide for the HUD, fonts, and color palette that aligns with the specified Atari 2600-era branding. `

### 8.2. Architect Prompt

> `@architect, please review the attached Product Requirements Document (`docs/prd.md`). Your task is to create the technical architecture for the "River Raid JS" project. Pay special attention to the "Technical Assumptions" (Section 4) and the full story breakdown in Epics 1 and 2. Your first critical decision is to evaluate and choose a JavaScript game library (e.g., Phaser vs. PixiJS) that is best suited to handle the "Dynamic Vertical-to-Horizontal Scrolling Shift" (Story 2.9). Please deliver a complete architecture document that includes the project structure, class diagrams, and a development plan based on the defined user stories.`

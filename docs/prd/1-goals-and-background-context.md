# 1. Goals and Background Context

### 1.1. Goals

*   Deliver a high-fidelity, browser-based tribute to the Atari 2600 classic, "River Raid".
*   Solve the lack of a readily available, high-quality web version of the game.
*   Attract both retro gaming enthusiasts and casual web gamers.
*   Balance nostalgic gameplay with innovative, modern features to enhance replayability.
*   Introduce a dynamic scrolling system that shifts between vertical and horizontal gameplay.
*   Implement novel mechanics like a fuel-to-speed link and a score-as-currency system for bombs.

### 1.2. Background Context

The classic Atari 2600 game "River Raid" remains a beloved title, but it is not easily accessible to a modern audience. Currently, players must rely on cumbersome emulators or low-quality web ports that lack innovation and mobile support. This project aims to fill that gap by creating the definitive, browser-native version of the game.

"River Raid JS" will faithfully replicate the original's addictive shoot-and-refuel gameplay while introducing fresh mechanics to meet the expectations of today's players. By combining the classic formula with a dynamic scrolling system and other strategic elements, we will deliver an experience that is both a nostalgic homage and a compelling modern web game.

# Story 1.2: Render Player Jet

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** player,  
**I want** to see my jet on the screen,  
**so that** I can visually identify my character in the game world.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A placeholder 2D sprite for the player's jet is loaded and displayed on the screen.
2. The jet is centered horizontally and positioned near the bottom of the screen by default.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- Phaser 3.70.0 game engine is initialized and working
- BootScene is implemented for asset loading with proper scene transition
- GameScene exists but is currently minimal 
- EntityManager, RenderManager, and StateManager architecture is defined but not yet implemented
- Asset loading infrastructure through AssetManifest pattern is established
- Project structure follows unified-project-structure.md with proper directories

### Data Models
Player entity must implement the following interface structure: [Source: architecture/section-4-data-models.md#Player]
```typescript
interface Player {
  x: number;           // Horizontal position on screen
  y: number;           // Vertical position on screen  
  fuel: number;        // Current fuel level (0-100)
  maxSpeed: number;    // Maximum speed based on fuel level
  currentSpeed: number; // Current movement speed
  lives: number;       // Remaining lives (future feature)
  isAlive: boolean;    // Whether player is active
}
```

### Component Specifications
Player class must follow the component template pattern: [Source: architecture/section-10-frontend-architecture.md#Component Template]
- Extend Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite and implement IPlayer interface
- Constructor: `constructor(scene: Scene, x: number, y: number)`
- Use `scene.add.existing(this)` and `scene.physics.add.existing(this)`
- Set proper depth layer with `this.setDepth(10)` for correct rendering order
- Include update method signature: `update(delta: number, inputManager: InputManager): void`

Entity Manager integration requirements: [Source: architecture/section-6-components.md#Entity Manager]
- Entity lifecycle must be managed through EntityManager using object pooling pattern
- Use `EntityManager.spawnPlayer()` method for creation
- Implement `recycleEntity()` for proper cleanup

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure: [Source: architecture/section-12-unified-project-structure.md]
- Player entity: `apps/web/src/game/entities/Player.ts`
- Asset manifest: `apps/web/src/game/config/AssetManifest.ts` 
- Player sprites: `apps/web/public/assets/sprites/player_jet.png` (or appropriate format)
- Unit tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/Player.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `apps/web/tests/integration/player-rendering.test.ts`

### Asset Management Requirements
Asset handling must follow AssetManifest pattern: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Never hardcode asset paths - use AssetManifest.ts constants only
- Define asset key in AssetManifest using snake_case: `player_sprite`
- Load assets in BootScene using the defined constants
- Sprite should be positioned for center-bottom placement by default

### Technical Constraints
Version requirements: [Source: architecture/section-3-tech-stack.md]
- Phaser 3.70.0 for 2D game engine and rendering
- ES2022 target for core game logic
- No external UI component library - use Phaser GameObjects only

Physics Integration: [Source: architecture/section-6-components.md#Physics Manager]
- Enable Phaser Arcade Physics with `scene.physics.add.existing(this)`
- Set collision bounds to match sprite dimensions for future collision detection
- Physics body will be used for boundary checking with river collision system

### Testing Requirements
Testing must follow established patterns: [Source: previous story completion notes]
- Use Vitest 1.6.0 for unit and integration tests
- Playwright 1.44.0 for E2E testing (if needed)
- Tests must validate both functional behavior and visual rendering
- All tests must pass in CI pipeline before story completion
- Minimum coverage: Player entity creation, positioning, asset loading, scene integration

### Project Structure Notes
All file paths align with unified-project-structure.md requirements. The entity will integrate with existing managers (EntityManager, RenderManager, StateManager) that are architecturally defined but need implementation as part of this story's scope.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Implementation Status:** ✅ Complete
- All 6 tasks completed with comprehensive implementation
- 44/44 tests passing (13 unit + 9 integration tests)
- Build successful with TypeScript validation
- All acceptance criteria fulfilled

**Key Findings:**
- Player entity properly extends Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite with IPlayer interface
- Asset management follows AssetManifest pattern with runtime sprite generation
- Correct positioning: horizontally centered (400px) and near bottom (520px) for 800x600 game
- Proper integration with EntityManager, StateManager, and RenderManager singletons
- Clean separation of concerns and architectural compliance

**Minor Optimization Note:**
- Build warning about Phaser.js chunk size (1.4MB) is typical for Phaser games but could benefit from code splitting in future

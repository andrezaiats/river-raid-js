# Story 1.1: Initial Project & Game Library Setup

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to set up the initial Git repository, file structure, and integrate a chosen JavaScript game library,  
**so that** I have a foundational, runnable project structure to build the game upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A Git repository is initialized for the project.
2. The standard file structure (`/src`, `/assets`, `index.html`) is created.
3. A JS game library (e.g., Phaser, PixiJS) is installed and configured to render a blank canvas in the browser.
4. The project is deployed to a static hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages) and is accessible via a URL.

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Requirements
**[Source: architecture/section-12-unified-project-structure.md]**

The project must follow the exact monorepo structure specified: 
- **Root structure**: Use apps/ for applications, packages/ for shared code
- **Frontend location**: apps/web/ contains the main game application
- **Game code organization**: src/game/ with scenes/, entities/, managers/ subdirectories
- **Asset organization**: public/assets/ with sprites/, audio/, fonts/ subdirectories
- **Testing structure**: tests/ with unit/ and integration/ subdirectories
- **Configuration files**: Individual package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts in apps/web/

### Technology Stack Requirements
**[Source: architecture/section-3-tech-stack.md]**

**CRITICAL VERSIONS - Use these exact versions:**
- **Frontend Language**: JavaScript ES2022 (no transpilation needed)
- **Game Engine**: Phaser 3.70.0 (comprehensive 2D game features)
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.2.0 (lightning fast, ESM native)
- **Bundler**: Rollup 4.17.0 (via Vite, tree shaking enabled)
- **Testing**: Vitest 1.6.0 for unit tests, Playwright 1.44.0 for E2E
- **Deployment**: Vercel with GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics (basic tier)

**No Backend Required**: This is a client-side only application for MVP

### Frontend Architecture Patterns
**[Source: architecture/section-10-frontend-architecture.md]**

**Scene Management Setup:**
- **BootScene.ts**: Asset loading scene (must be first scene)
- **Scene Flow**: BootScene → StartScene → GameScene → GameOverScene
- Use Phaser's built-in scene management system

**Component Organization:**
- **Game Logic**: src/game/ with scenes/, entities/, managers/, config/
- **Managers**: InputManager, EntityManager, AudioManager, StateManager
- **Configuration**: GameConfig.ts, AssetManifest.ts in config/

### Coding Standards Requirements
**[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]**

**Critical File Organization Rules:**
- **Type Definitions**: All types must be in packages/shared/src/types
- **Asset References**: Use AssetManifest.ts constants only, never hardcode paths
- **Game Configuration**: Use camelCase for Phaser config objects

**Naming Conventions:**
- **Game Scenes**: PascalCase with 'Scene' suffix (BootScene.ts, StartScene.ts)
- **Managers**: PascalCase with 'Manager' suffix
- **Asset Keys**: snake_case (player_sprite, explosion_sound)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

### Development Workflow
**[Source: architecture/section-13-development-workflow.md]**

**Git Workflow**: Standard feature branch workflow with main as production branch
**Build Process**: Vite handles development server and production builds
**Deployment**: Automatic deployment to Vercel on main branch push

### Testing

**Testing Framework**: Vitest 1.6.0 for unit testing
**Test Location**: apps/web/tests/unit/ for unit tests
**E2E Testing**: Playwright 1.44.0 for automated gameplay testing
**Test Standards**: Follow Jest-compatible patterns with Vitest

**Testing Requirements for this story:**
- Test that Phaser initializes without errors
- Test that the game canvas renders properly
- Test that the build process completes successfully
- Test that the deployment is accessible via URL

## QA Results

### Review Date: September 26, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Grade: B+ (Strong Foundation, Missing Tests)**

The implementation demonstrates excellent architectural understanding and follows the specified requirements closely. The monorepo structure is properly configured, Phaser integration is clean and well-organized, and the development workflow is production-ready. However, there's a critical gap in test coverage that needs immediate attention.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/web/src/main.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed incomplete error handler event listener
  - **Why**: Prevented potential runtime errors from uncaught exceptions  
  - **How**: Completed the truncated addEventListener call with proper callback function

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **PASS** - Follows naming conventions, proper asset organization, camelCase for Phaser configs
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **PASS** - Monorepo structure exactly matches unified-project-structure.md specification
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ **FAIL** - Test directories exist but are completely empty despite story requirements
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ **PARTIAL** - Technical requirements met but missing test validation mentioned in AC testing requirements

### Improvements Checklist

[Check off items you handled yourself, leave unchecked for dev to address]

- [x] Fixed error handler in main.ts for better error reporting
- [x] Verified exact version compliance with tech stack requirements
- [x] Confirmed project structure matches architectural specifications
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement unit tests for Phaser initialization and scene loading
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Add integration tests for build process and canvas rendering 
- [ ] Add basic test that verifies game initializes without errors (story requirement)
- [ ] Add test that validates canvas renders properly (story requirement)
- [ ] Add test for build process completion (story requirement)
- [ ] Add test for deployment URL accessibility (story requirement)
- [ ] Update CI placeholders with actual test execution
- [ ] Consider adding ESLint configuration for consistent code quality

### Security Review

✓ **PASS** - No security concerns identified. Basic web application with no user data collection, proper CSP considerations, and no external API dependencies.

### Performance Considerations

✓ **PASS** - Excellent performance setup:
- Vite 5.2.0 with optimized build configuration
- Proper code splitting with Phaser in separate chunk  
- ES2022 target for modern browser optimization
- Responsive scaling configuration for mobile compatibility
- Asset optimization and loading strategies in place

### Files Modified During Review

- **Modified**: apps/web/src/main.ts (fixed error handler)
- **Created**: docs/qa/gates/1.1-initial-project-setup.yml (quality gate decision)

*Please update File List to include the gate file*

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.1-initial-project-setup.yml  
Quality Score: 75/100 (excellent foundation minus test coverage penalty)  
Risk Profile: Low-Medium (missing test validation creates moderate risk)

**Primary Concern**: Story claims test requirements are met but no actual tests exist. The testing infrastructure is properly configured (Vitest, Playwright, CI placeholders) but no test files were created.

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Complete test implementation before marking as Done

**Critical Path**: 
1. Implement the 4 tests mentioned in story Testing section
2. Remove CI placeholder comments and enable actual test execution  
3. Verify all tests pass in CI pipeline
4. Then mark story as Done

**Note**: This is strong foundational work that demonstrates excellent engineering practices. The test gap is the only blocking issue preventing full approval.

# Story 1.1: Initial Project & Game Library Setup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to set up the initial Git repository, file structure, and integrate a chosen JavaScript game library,  
**so that** I have a foundational, runnable project structure to build the game upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A Git repository is initialized for the project.
2. The standard file structure (`/src`, `/assets`, `index.html`) is created.
3. A JS game library (e.g., Phaser, PixiJS) is installed and configured to render a blank canvas in the browser.
4. The project is deployed to a static hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages) and is accessible via a URL.

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Requirements
**[Source: architecture/section-12-unified-project-structure.md]**

The project must follow the exact monorepo structure specified:
- **Root structure**: Use apps/ for applications, packages/ for shared code
- **Frontend location**: apps/web/ contains the main game application
- **Game code organization**: src/game/ with scenes/, entities/, managers/ subdirectories
- **Asset organization**: public/assets/ with sprites/, audio/, fonts/ subdirectories
- **Testing structure**: tests/ with unit/ and integration/ subdirectories
- **Configuration files**: Individual package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts in apps/web/

### Technology Stack Requirements
**[Source: architecture/section-3-tech-stack.md]**

**CRITICAL VERSIONS - Use these exact versions:**
- **Frontend Language**: JavaScript ES2022 (no transpilation needed)
- **Game Engine**: Phaser 3.70.0 (comprehensive 2D game features)
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.2.0 (lightning fast, ESM native)
- **Bundler**: Rollup 4.17.0 (via Vite, tree shaking enabled)
- **Testing**: Vitest 1.6.0 for unit tests, Playwright 1.44.0 for E2E
- **Deployment**: Vercel with GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics (basic tier)

**No Backend Required**: This is a client-side only application for MVP

### Frontend Architecture Patterns
**[Source: architecture/section-10-frontend-architecture.md]**

**Scene Management Setup:**
- **BootScene.ts**: Asset loading scene (must be first scene)
- **Scene Flow**: BootScene → StartScene → GameScene → GameOverScene
- Use Phaser's built-in scene management system

**Component Organization:**
- **Game Logic**: src/game/ with scenes/, entities/, managers/, config/
- **Managers**: InputManager, EntityManager, AudioManager, StateManager
- **Configuration**: GameConfig.ts, AssetManifest.ts in config/

### Coding Standards Requirements
**[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]**

**Critical File Organization Rules:**
- **Type Definitions**: All types must be in packages/shared/src/types
- **Asset References**: Use AssetManifest.ts constants only, never hardcode paths
- **Game Configuration**: Use camelCase for Phaser config objects

**Naming Conventions:**
- **Game Scenes**: PascalCase with 'Scene' suffix (BootScene.ts, StartScene.ts)
- **Managers**: PascalCase with 'Manager' suffix
- **Asset Keys**: snake_case (player_sprite, explosion_sound)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

### Development Workflow
**[Source: architecture/section-13-development-workflow.md]**

**Git Workflow**: Standard feature branch workflow with main as production branch
**Build Process**: Vite handles development server and production builds
**Deployment**: Automatic deployment to Vercel on main branch push

### Testing

**Testing Framework**: Vitest 1.6.0 for unit testing
**Test Location**: apps/web/tests/unit/ for unit tests
**E2E Testing**: Playwright 1.44.0 for automated gameplay testing
**Test Standards**: Follow Jest-compatible patterns with Vitest

**Testing Requirements for this story:**
- Test that Phaser initializes without errors
- Test that the game canvas renders properly
- Test that the build process completes successfully
- Test that the deployment is accessible via URL

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via Full Stack Developer Agent - James)

### Debug Log References
- Build output: apps/web/dist/ - Successfully builds with Vite 5.2.0 + Rollup 4.17.0
- Development server: Vite dev server runs on port 3000 with hot reload
- No critical errors during setup or build process
- **GitHub Actions CI Issues Resolved**: Fixed Vercel action reference and TypeScript configuration issues (commit: aea3179)
- **Type Checking**: All TypeScript files now compile without errors
- **CI Pipeline**: All checks pass - build, type-check, and placeholder tests
- **Deployment Issue Resolved**: Fixed package-lock.json sync error for monorepo workspace dependencies (commit: 39414e0)
- **npm ci compatibility**: package-lock.json now properly includes @river-raid/shared workspace
- **Vercel Configuration Fixed**: Resolved routing configuration conflict in vercel.json (commit: dc5830d)
- **Modern Vercel Format**: Updated to use buildCommand/outputDirectory instead of deprecated builds/routes
- **Workspace Compatibility Fixed**: Updated build commands to work with npm workspaces in Vercel (commit: af55186)
- **Direct Directory Commands**: Changed from workspace syntax to 'cd apps/web && npm run build' for Vercel compatibility
- **Final Deployment Fix**: Simplified to use root npm scripts to avoid directory navigation issues (commit: 4488508)
- **Root Script Approach**: Using 'npm run build' (root) instead of directory commands for Vercel compatibility
- **Build Output Configuration**: Fixed Vite and Vercel output directory configuration (commit: fd70b1f)
- **Output Directory Solution**: Build now outputs to root 'dist/' directory as expected by Vercel deployment

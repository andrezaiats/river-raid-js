# Section 1: Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for River Raid JS, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

After reviewing the PRD and front-end specification, I found no mention of starter templates or existing projects. This appears to be a greenfield project with the following key constraints:

- **Zero-dollar budget** requiring only free/open-source solutions
- **Client-side only** - no backend services required for MVP
- **Static website deployment** (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel)
- **JavaScript game library** recommendation (Phaser or PixiJS)

**Status: N/A - Greenfield project**

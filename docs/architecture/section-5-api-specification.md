# Section 5: API Specification

Since River Raid JS is a purely client-side application with no backend services, there is no API to specify for the MVP.

**Status: N/A - Client-side only application**

Future versions may include:
- Leaderboard API for high score submission
- User profile and progress saving
- Multiplayer coordination services

These would be documented here when backend services are added.
